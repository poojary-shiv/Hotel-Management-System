# Hotel-Management-System
A website for an enterprise, having a chain of hotels in multiple countries or a specific nation. 


**Overview:**
The website contains the details about the various branches located in mega cities. It also includes a brief information about the hotel, facilities provided, its location, ratings, contact details, location and a lot more.
It is acting as a common portal for booking of rooms across the hotels, in a much easier and hassle free manner. It gives users a glimpse of the probable experience when visited.
The website is also a platform for the regular customers to express their satisfaction and suggest constructive feedbacks, if any. Any customers or new members seeking help can also connect to the support team using it as a medium.

The entire system is supported using a database (phpMyAdmin). The database has a collection of over 9-10 entities. They are person, customer, staff, testimonials, transaction, coupon, hotel, room type, room and enquiry. These entities and their relations are managed by a group of 18 relations (tables). Various DML commands like select, insert, update, delete and nested queries are used to achieve the desired output.
 
Thus, looking at the present rapidly growing market’s demand and requirement of people, it is acting as a connecting bridge between tourists, travelers and hotel management community.
